# pyFilter
pyFilter aims to filter out all of the requests that are not legitimate to your server, and blocks them if too many are sent. It works by reading log files and checking if a failed request has came from the same IP address within a user configurable amount of time and adding rules to the firewall if too many attempts have been captured.

By default pyFilter is configured to read from `/var/log/auth.log` for incoming SSH requests, however there are options for `Apache, Nginx and MySQL` too.

pyFilter uses a database to store all the banned ip addresses to ensure ips arent added more than once. pyFilter currently supports sqlite and redis, by default it is setup to use sqlite so no installation of a redis server is needed.

Installation:
-------------

Required:
- [Python3](http://www.python.org)

Optional:
- [py-redis](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/redis)
- [redis](https://redis.io)

To install pyFilter download the files from this repo via your preferred method, for example `git clone https://github.com/Jason2605/pyFilter.git`.

**Optional:** `install.sh` will setup a service for pyFilter, and you can start/stop it by using `sudo systemctl start/stop pyFilter` and get the status of the pyFilter service using `sudo systemctl status pyFilter`.

**Note: The default configuration file runs on sqlite, so installing py-redis and redis are optional.**

To install py-redis
  `pip install redis`

To add more rules just add another section.
```json
      "mariadb": {
        "log_files": ["/var/log/x"],
        "regex_patterns": [
          "(\\d{4}-\\d{2}-\\d{2} \\d{2}:\\d{2}:\\d{2}) .* Access denied for user '.*'@'(.*)' .*"
        ],
        "time_format": "%Y-%m-%d  %H:%M:%S"
      },
```
### Database

To swap from sqlite to redis, change the current value `"database": "sqlite"` to `"database": "redis"`.

### Reload iptables

`iptables` is not persistant over restarts, so this setting will reload the table with the saved bans so far on launch and update the rules.

### Log files

`"log_file": "/var/log/auth.log"` This will read from the specified file, and add bans as the events happen. 

### Regex patterns

The regex patterns **have** to match an IP address and a timestamp, preferably matching the timestamp first.

### Time format

The time format needs to match the log format to form a datetime object. For example `2017-10-30 13:37:11` will match with `%Y-%m-%d  %H:%M:%S`.

#### Some common characters
```
%Y -> Year
%m -> Month (Month as number form e.g 10 = October)
%b -> Month (Month as abbreviated name e.g Oct)
%B -> Month (Month as full name e.g October)
%d -> Day
%H -> Hour
%S -> Second
%d -> Day within a month (e.g 1 for 1st of the month)
```
[Full list](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#strftime-strptime-behavior)

### Ignored IP addresses

This is quite explanitory, if a regex matches however the IP address is within this list, it will be ignored so that IP address will not get banned.

You can add more IPs
`"ignored_ips": ["127.0.0.1", "123.456.789.1"]`

### Request time

Request time, is the time **in seconds** the responses have to be sent, so for example `"request_time": 5` if two requests are sent within 5 seconds of each other, that will add an attempt to that IP address, if that happens 5 times they will be blacklisted and added to the firewall rules. 

### Deny type

Deny type is the way iptables will deal with the incoming packets, `DENY` is recommended however you may also `REJECT` them.

### Failed attempts

Failed attempts is the number of matches that IP address needs to get trying to connect each rule for it to get blacklisted, for example `"failed_attempts": 5` 5 failed attempts on an SSH connection will get it banned, however 3 on SSH and 2 on MySQL will not get it banned, they are seperate.

### Run once

This setting will only run the script once and not check many times, useful if you want to create your own more advanced schedules.

### Check time

Check time is the amount of time in seconds it takes to do each rule, for example `"check_time": 600` check time is 600 seconds and there are 4 rules, there will be a gap of 150 seconds until the next rule is run, and a 600 second wait until the same rule is run again.

### Redis - Optional

Host is the ip address of where the redis server is located. The `"database"` option is the database you want the banned IP addresses to be stored in, by default within redis the options are 0 to 15. If you have a password for your redis server change `"password": null` to `"password": "your password"`.

Running:
--------
Note: To run this you will need sudo privileges, and will need to ensure the bash files have correct permissions.
```
$ ./run.sh
```
